After applying Identity or NOT operator, we can easily determine the init value by checking the final value.
- In the case of Identity operator, we simply say the same value.
- In the case of NOT operator, we simply say the other value, i.e., if the final value is 0 (resp., 1), then we say 1 (resp., 0).

However, we cannot know the init value by checking the final value after applying ZERO or ONE operator.

Based on this observation, we can classify the operators into two types: _Reversible_ and _Irreversible_.
- If we can recover the init value(s) from the final value(s), then the operator is called reversible like Identity & NOT operators.
- If we cannot know the init value(s) from the final value(s), then the operator is called irreversible like ZERO & ONE operators.
**This classification is important, as the quantum evolution operators are reversible** (as long as the system is closed). The Identity & NOT operators are $2$ fundamental quantum operators.

[[Quantum state]] of the **control qubit (C)** before CNOT: $|0⟩H−→1√2|0⟩+1√2|1⟩$.
[[Quantum state]] of the **target qubit (T)** before CNOT: $|1⟩H−→1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩$.

The [[Quantum state]] of the composite system: $(1√2|0⟩+1√2|1⟩)C⊗(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)T$

CNOT affects when the controlled qubit has the value |1⟩.

Let's rewrite the composite state as below to explicitly represent the effect of CNOT. Before CNOT we have: $1√2|0⟩C⊗(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)T+1√2|1⟩C⊗(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)T$

CNOT flips the state of the target qubit. After CNOT, we have: $1√2|0⟩C⊗(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)T+1√2|1⟩C⊗(1√2|1⟩−1√2|0⟩)T$

Remark that $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$ are swapped in the second term of above expression. If we write the [[Quantum state]] of the target qubit as before, the sign of $|1⟩$ in the control qubit should be flipped.

Thus the last equation can be equivalently written as follows: $1√2|0⟩C⊗(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)T−1√2|1⟩C⊗(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)T$

Before CNOT operator, the sign of $|1⟩$ in the control qubit is positive. After CNOT operator, its sign changes to negative. This is called **phase-kickback**.

After CNOT
It is easy to see from the last expression, that the quantum states of the [[Qubits]] are separable (no correlation): $(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)C⊗(1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩)T$
If we apply Hadamard to each qubit, both [[Qubits]] evolve to state $|1⟩$.
$1√2|0⟩−1√2|1⟩H−→|1⟩$. The final state is $|11⟩$.
